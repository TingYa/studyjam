1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,810
所以现在你已经明白了fragment是在哪里使用的
So now you know, where fragments are used and

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,700
并且知道了我们将会在我们的应用哪个地方中去使用它
where we're going to use them in our app. You're

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,070
你可能会开始问，究竟为什么要使用fragment呢？
probably starting to ask, why use fragments at all?

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,810
如果你想要做一个UI组件，难道我们不能只是创建一个
If we want to group UI components, couldn't we just create

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,520
View Group或者一个重用的XML布局定义吗？
a View Group or maybe a re-usable XML layout

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,240
当然可以，但是，fragment的真实能力是高于
definition? Yes. But, the real power in fragments goes

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,220
grouping UI element的，fragment可以使activity
beyond grouping UI elements. They allow us to fully

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,350
充分模块化，包括它们从保持的应用状态
modularize our activities, including the life cycle events they receive

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,990
中接收到的生命周期事件，fragment是从Honeycomb的时候开始
in the app state that they maintain. Fragments were

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,090
用来解决这个特别的问题的。
first introduced in Honeycomb to solve a particular problem. Honeycomb

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,390
Honeycomb是第一个支持平板的Android版本。
was the first Android release to support tablets, and

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,680
事实证明，去创建平板UI界面
it turned out, the best way for most apps to

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,780
的最好方式是将两个或者
create a great tablet UI. Is put two or

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,910
多个phone activity并排。举个栗子
more, of their phone activities alongside each other. For example,

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,710
如果你有一个手机应用是使用list activity启动的
if you had a phone app that started with a

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,520
就像这样，当你点击一个项会
list activity like this, which you then clicked an item

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,570
打开detail activity，就像这个我们
would open a detailed activity like this one. What

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,840
称为master detail flow的一样
we call a master detail flow. A good tablet

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,060
一个好的平板UI界面会将它们并排，就像这样
UI would put them side by side like this.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,760
从功能上讲，点击这个列表上的项，将这个activity放在右边
Functionally, clicking an item on this list, now replaces this

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,310
而不是和在手机上一样
activity on the right, rather than starting a new

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,680
打开一个新的activity
one, as it would have done on the phone.

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,940
不幸的是，Android并不总是支持在其他activity中嵌入activity
Now unfortunately, Android didn't always support embedding activities within

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,410
至少并不能，直到我们介绍了fragment
other activities. At least, it didn't until we introduced fragments.

25
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,260
现在如果你只是看了一下UI元素
Now if you just look at the UI elements, you could

26
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,470
你可以思考一下你可以使用U Group和layout构建的
be excused for thinking you could achieve much the same thing

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,870
activity来达到同样的事情
using an activity that was built using U Groups and layouts,

28
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,630
而不是使用fragment，在一定程度上这是对的
without bothering the fragments, which is true up to a point.

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,712
但是，你将必须通过所有activity的生命周期事件
But then you'd have to pass through all of the activity

30
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:37,860
管理每一个UI的状态
life cycle events, manage the state of each piece of the

31
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,390
当它们改变的时候，跟踪他们的每一部分
UI, keep track of the state of each of the portions

32
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,770
并且要记住，为了维持应用的状态，
as they changed. And remember, which screen elements were on screen

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,710
在任何特定的时间上，屏幕上的元素都是显示在屏幕上的
at any given time, in order to maintain app state.

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,470
这所有的一切，就是当你使用fragment时Fragment管理器
All of which, is exactly what the Fragment Manager does

35
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,500
替你做的事情。而这使你退后一步
for you, when you use Fragments. And that lets you

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,230
把每一个fragment当做还一个小的activity
take a step back and, and treat each fragment as though

37
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,240
举个栗子，在activity的世界中
it were a mini activity. For example, in the world

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,400
你从一个activity中启动另一个activity，就会在后台的堆中
of activities, you start one activity from the other, and that

39
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
记录下transaction。所以，点击返回按钮，
transaction is recorded on the back stack. So, hitting the

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,090
我们将撤销transaction并且将第一个activity
Back button, we'll undo that transaction and bring the first activity

41
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,310
放置在前面。而现在可以用fragment transaction
to the front. Now the same thing can

42
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,870
实现同样的事情。在这个例子中，
happen with fragment transactions. In this case, rather

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,580
我们只需要用detail activity替换 list activity
than starting a new activity, we simply replace

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,480
而不是开始一个新的activity。
the list fragment with the detail fragment. And then

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,740
然后返回按钮会撤销这个transaction并反过来
the back button will undo that transaction and

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,210
所以，在理论上来说，你可以
reverse it. So in theory, you can really take

47
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,880
采用任何有多重activity的方法并且用
any act with multiple activities and replace it

48
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,950
一个单个的activity代替它
with a single activity that's host to multiple fragments.
