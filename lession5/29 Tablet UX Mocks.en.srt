1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,600
当我们学习响应式设计时候，我们可以看到
When we were learning that response in design, we saw that

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,360
常见的模式都是使用 master detail flow，就和我们
a common pattern was to use the master detail flow, which

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,410
将要在sunshine这个应用中使用的一样。这是在平板上的
is what were going to use for sunshine. Here are the

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,580
效果。在左边有forecast列表，
tablet mocks. We have a list of forecasts on the left, and

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,220
当选中它们的时候，我们可以在右边看到详细的信息格子
then for the selected item, we see the detail pane on

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,080
无论是纵向还是横向，这种方法都适用于
the right. This applies for a seven inch and ten inch tablets.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,380
7英寸和十英寸的平板电脑。在纵向模式下，列项
Both portrait and landscape orientations. In portrait mode, the columns are

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,670
只是有一点点窄而已，但它仍然是两个窗口的UI界面
just a little bit narrower, but it's still a two pane UI.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,220
这些都会在main activity下实现
In terms of implementation, all of this will be under the

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,020
在左边是forecast fragment
main activity. Then on the left, we have the forecast fragment.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,070
在右边是detail fragment
And then on the right, we have the detail fragment. On

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,846
而在手机上，我们在main activity下只有左边的这个预报列表
the phone, we would still have the main activity with the list

13
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,580
当选中其中的一个项时，会跳转到
of forecast. And then selecting an item would still launch the

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,480
detail activity。这是另一种展示方式。在平板电脑上，
detail activity. Here's another way to visualize it. On the tablet, we

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,630
在一个activity上有两个紧接着的fragment，而在手机上
have two fragments side by side under one activity. And then

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,030
我们的第一个activity包含了第一个fragment
on the phone, we have the first activity containing the first fragment.

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,080
当选中了一个项后，会跳转到包含第二个fragment的activity
Selecting an item will launch the second activity containing the second

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,640
我们将把这些分成多个编码任务
fragment. We're going to break this up into multiple coding tasks until

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,140
直到我们建立最后一个layout布局。首先，我们为平板电脑建立两个
we build up the final layout. First we'll build up the

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,460
窗口UI界面。接下来我们将两个fragment
two pane UI for tablets. Then we'll hook up the communication

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,070
之间进行通信，即选择一项在右边的窗口
between the two fragments, so that's selecting an item replaces the

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,530
显示详细信息。接着我们会学习如何
detail pane on the right. Then we'll learn how to show

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,590
在一个被选中项上展示其状态，所以
an activated state on the currently selected item, so we know

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,100
我们就会知道详细信息与哪一个相对应。我们还需要确保
what the details pane corresponds to. We'll also need to make

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,630
滚动的位置被维持在一个方向
sure that the scroll position is maintained across

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,430
上变化。做完这些以后，我们将更新detail layout
orientation changes. After that, we'll update the detail layout

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,730
去优化这些更宽的屏幕。
so it's optimized for these wider screens. And

28
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,370
然后，我们将修改adapter所以在这里，“今天”的布局和
then we'll modify the adapter so that today's layout

29
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,340
“其他天”的布局看起来是一样的。在平板上，“today”的布局
looks like the other days. There's no special

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,980
并没有什么特殊之处。所以充满希望的是
today layout on the tablet. So hopefully it's clear

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,930
我们如何实现这个在平板上的表现行为的思路是很清晰的
how we're going to approach implementing this tablet behavior and

32
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,660
我们将会一个接一个地去慢慢实现
we're going to step through it slowly, one by one
