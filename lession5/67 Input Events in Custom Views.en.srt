在创建自定义视图的最后一步就是增加interactivity

按键，轨迹球的移动，
input events including key presses, trackball movement, and

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,570
还有更重要的是，屏幕触摸事件
most importantly, screen touch events, all by overriding the

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,950
这些都是通过重载相应的事件处理程序实现的，Android支持多达
corresponding event handlers. Android supports tracking of up

00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,570
11个接触点的追踪，我们

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,710
称之为“爵士手”模式，它可以

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,550
使你完成复杂的多指互动模式
you to complete complex and multi-finger interaction models. Now,

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,400
而对于风向来说，现在这里没有互动的需求
there's really no interaction required for a wind gauge, but

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,130
但是你可以通过查阅那些描述
you can find out more about handling input events by checking

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,170
如何创建应用的完全互动视图的文档
the motion event docs or the developer guide describing how to

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,890
或者开发者指南得知更多有关处理输入事件的知识，
create your own, fully interactive custom views, both from the [UNKNOWN]

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,110
现在，不要让这个新发现的力量迷昏了头脑
below. Now, be careful not to let this new found power

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,220
因为你的用户永远不会遇到
go to your head. By definition, your users will have never

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,900
你使用的新控件，所以学习如何使用它就是
encountered your brand spanking new control. So learning how to use

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,550
将使你的应用使用起来更爱不释手
it is going to add friction to the use of your app.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,650
最起码，它应该和系统中的其他部分表现一致
At the very least, it should behave consistently with the rest of the system

18
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,310
并且你应该避免自己创建系统控件
and you should avoid creating your own

00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,680
如果它看起来像
versions of system controls. If it looks kind of

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,140
一个按钮，工作起来也像一个按钮，那你或许应该继续使用一个
like a button and works kind of like a button, you should probably just go ahead

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,620
按钮，但我认为这是不符合逻辑的即使它已经持续了很长时间了
and use a button, but I think this non sequitur has gone on long enough.
